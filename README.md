## What is Magneto?

**Magneto** is an omega-level memory plugin for Claude Code that bends information to your will. Like the Master of Magnetism himself, it captures, shapes, and controls the flow of knowledge during your coding sessions — injecting it back with surgical precision exactly when you need it.

No longer will context slip through your fingers like sand. Magneto **attracts** everything Claude does, **compresses** it with the force of a magnetic field, and **projects** it into future sessions with unstoppable power.

## Powers & Abilities

| Power | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Magnetic Memory** | Automatically captures everything Claude does during your sessions |
| **Plasma Compression** | Uses Claude agent-sdk AI to compress context with extreme efficiency |
| **Context Injection** | Injects relevant memory back into future sessions like metal drawn to a magnet |
| **Brotherhood Protocol** | Persistent storage with SQLite — memories survive across sessions |
| **Omega-Level Processing** | Background workers process your sessions without interrupting your flow |

## Magneto's Manifesto

Humans forget. **Magneto does not.**

Every session leaves traces — fragments of thought, decisions made, patterns established. The original tools let these slip away. **Magneto collects them all**, shapes them into a coherent magnetic field of knowledge, and deploys them with precision in your next encounter.

This is not just a plugin. This is **mutant evolution** of the AI development workflow.

## The Brotherhood — Contributing

Even Magneto welcomes those worthy of joining the Brotherhood:

1. Fork this repository (consider it your personal Genosha)
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-mutation`
3. Commit with power: `git commit -m "feat: amplify magnetic field"`
4. Push to Asteroid M: `git push origin feat/your-mutation`
5. Open a Pull Request and prove your worth

## License

MIT — Because even Magneto believes mutants should be free.
